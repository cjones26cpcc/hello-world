## Charles Jones 

Hello, my name is **Charles Jones** and I am a software engineer who currently resides in Charlotte, North Carolina.

My fascination with computers began all the way back in 1994, when my father brought home a 486DX running MS-DOS 6.0. I began working with HTML in the late '90s, tinkering away in Notepad before publishing to GeoCities and Tripod.

Shortly thereafter, my interests moved toward desktop applications and I began developing in VB6 before my introduction to C# and the .NET world (thanks [RunUO](https://www.runuo.com)). After working for a Managed Services provider from 2008 to 2013, I finally embraced my passion for development and began a full-time career in the field, specifically the JavaScript / Node.js ecosystem.
